Journal articles are about sharing knowledge
Any journal article starts with a question (why smt is working/not working the way it is)
Figure out how you're gonna study this question, how are you going to answer it 
Need to use theory /literature 
Literature reviews are important cz u need to know what has already written about the paticular topic 
Need to spend time reading about what has already been said about it

How much should you read? 
It depends on the research question (main question)
Specific questions
First write questions then look for answers.
the final review basically checks the answers to all your questions
The lit review is all about what others have said about the subject
So you are doing a lit review to verify existing claims and test predications made by those claims (your research might confirm or actually challenge those claims)
